-- 0224: the dashboard files everything on the company's day
-- (DECISIONS #175).
--
-- Until now dashboard_rollup filed calls, signed and collected money,
-- new contacts, last touches and finished jobs by the UTC day, which on
-- the West Coast starts at 5pm (4pm in winter). An evening's calls went
-- on tomorrow's bar, and a sale signed after 5pm on the 31st counted in
-- the next month. The app now sends the company's own day as "today"
-- (overdue tasks, today's appointments, overdue customer payments), so
-- the function has to file timestamps by that same calendar.
--
-- The function now takes the company's time zone (p_zone, sent by the
-- app) and files every timestamp on that zone's calendar. Nothing else
-- changes: the body is 0211's with `at time zone 'utc'` read
-- `at time zone p_zone`. p_zone defaults to 'UTC', so an app that
-- doesn't send it yet reads exactly as before. The old signature is
-- dropped so the database holds one dashboard_rollup.
--
-- Until this runs, the app works out the same numbers itself, more
-- slowly. Run in the Supabase SQL editor, after 0211. Safe to run twice.
