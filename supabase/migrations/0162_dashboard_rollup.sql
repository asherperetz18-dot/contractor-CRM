-- Dashboard 2.0: the whole dashboard reduced in the database, plus the
-- per-person panel order.
--
-- The old dashboard paged every open lead through the server on every
-- load just to sum one headline figure (~72k rows for "$4.4M"). This
-- function returns every card and graph's numbers in one call. Its
-- buckets are pinned by src/lib/data/dashboard-rollup.ts and its tests,
-- which also serve as the fallback while this migration hasn't run
-- (the page catches the missing-function error and computes the same
-- numbers from targeted queries -- slower, identical figures).
--
--   * Every clock-dependent edge (today, the window, the previous
--     window, the touch cutoffs) arrives as a parameter, computed once
--     in TypeScript -- the SQL and its mirror can never disagree about
--     what day it is. Timestamps bucket by their UTC date.
--   * A sale is a signed true contract (status 'Signed', kind
--     'contract') -- change orders excluded, same rule as Marketing
--     Analytics. Cash collected is succeeded portal payments (manual
--     and Stripe alike), dated by paid_at with created_at standing in.
--   * The receivables buckets run the Payments page's own phase math:
--     paid drops out, clearing is never overdue, a partly paid phase
--     keeps its remainder.
--   * The funnel is the window's cohort: of leads CREATED in the
--     window, how many got an appointment, saw a contract, signed.
--   * The stage panel buckets open-stage leads by updated_at -- "worked
--     in the last 30/60/90 days" -- because a book with years of
--     untouched leads makes "all open" read as one meaningless number.
--
-- profiles.dashboard_panel_order follows estimate_funnel_order (0145):
-- the dragged order of the dashboard boxes, own row only via the
-- existing profiles_update_self policy; null means "never arranged".
--
-- security invoker, so RLS scopes every read exactly as the page's own
-- fetches. Idempotent; safe as one paste and safe to run twice.
