# Decisions

Why a non-obvious design/architecture call was made — so it doesn't get re-litigated or accidentally reverted later. Newest at the bottom. Format: Context → Decision → Consequence.

The first entries below were logged retroactively on 2026-09-09 while setting up this file, reconstructed from commit messages and in-code comments that already explained their own reasoning. Going forward, log a decision when you make it, not after.

## 001 — Owed-to-you tracked per phase, not per invoice
**Date:** 2026-09-08 (commit `604732a`)

**Context:** "Owed to you" on a project could show a deposit as if it paid down whichever invoice existed, which is wrong once a contract has multiple billing phases — a deposit belongs to the contract, not to one phase's invoice.

**Decision:** Compute what's owed per phase (`phaseReceivableCents` et al. in `src/lib/data/types.ts`), so a deposit is attributed correctly and never silently pays down an unrelated phase's invoice.

**Consequence:** Any future receivable/owed-money calculation must reason per-phase, not by netting a single running total against payments. See `src/lib/data/project-receivable.test.ts` for the guarding tests.

## 002 — `selectAll` for any table a company can grow past 1,000 rows
**Context:** A bare Supabase `.select()` stops at 1,000 rows with no error — it just silently returns a partial result. On the Schedule/Calendar pages this meant the newest appointments could quietly vanish once a company's event history passed that mark, with nothing in the UI or logs indicating data was missing.

**Decision:** Wrap any query against a table that can plausibly exceed 1,000 rows in `selectAll()` (`src/lib/data/select-all.ts`), which pages through with `.range()`.

**Consequence:** When adding a new "list everything for this company" query against `events`, `leads`, or similarly unbounded tables, use `selectAll` by default rather than a bare `.select()`. A missing wrapper here is a real, previously-hit bug class, not a hypothetical one — see `docs/TECH_DEBT.md` if you find one.

## 003 — Calendar/Schedule fetch only leads with an event, not the whole company
**Context:** The calendar page was loading every lead in the company to render a week of appointments — at 3,573 contacts that was 833kB of response for 72 contacts that actually had an appointment, and was the reason the calendar took seconds to appear while the server itself answered in well under half a second.

**Decision:** Use an inner join on `events` (`leads.select("*, events!inner(id)")`) as a filter rather than fetching everything and filtering client-side, or building an id list (which could outgrow a request URL as history grows). The joined `events` key is dropped before the data reaches any consumer — it's a filter, not data anyone reads.

**Consequence:** When a page only needs "leads that have X," prefer an inner join as the filter over fetch-everything-then-filter. Watch for the same shape of bug (fetching a whole tenant's data for a UI that only needs a small related slice) elsewhere as the CRM grows.

## 004 — Dispatcher commission and sales-rep commission are separate pages, never combined
**Context:** They're different schemes paid to different people out of different money — the dispatcher earns a percentage of the gross sale for bringing the lead in, the rep earns a share of what the job actually made after costs. Putting both on one page or one number invited them to be read as the same figure, and would have exposed the dispatcher scheme to reps who shouldn't see it.

**Decision:** Keep `/commissions` (dispatcher) and `/sales-commission` (rep) as fully separate pages/routes/permissions, never merged into one "commissions" view.

**Consequence:** Don't consolidate these into a single commissions module without re-deriving this reasoning first — it isn't accidental duplication.

---

## 005 — Portal access: magic link + passcode challenge + separate revocable grant
**Context:** Customers open portal links hours or days after they're sent, by which point a plain long-lived link alone is a weak gate — most such links arrive functionally dead as a security boundary even before anyone tries to abuse them.

**Decision:** Layer three independent controls: a single-use magic link (can't be replayed once redeemed), a street-number passcode challenge as a second factor for leads that have one on file, and portal access as a separate office-controlled grant that can be revoked instantly regardless of the link's own state.

**Consequence:** Portal auth is intentionally not the same code path as staff auth (`getCurrentProfile()`) — don't assume the two are interchangeable when touching `src/app/portal/*` or `src/lib/portal/session.ts`.

---

## 006 — CI runs lint + test + build on every push/PR
**Date:** 2026-09-09

**Context:** There was no CI at all — nothing ran lint, tests, or a build on push, so any of the three could break on `main` unnoticed. `npm run build` was initially assumed to need Supabase/Stripe/etc. secrets (several `src/lib/*-env.ts` modules read them), which would make CI fail for a reason unrelated to the code being pushed. Verified instead of assumed: ran `npm run build` locally with zero env vars set. It succeeds — every route touching those env vars is server-rendered on demand (`ƒ`, not statically prerendered), so nothing reads them at build time.

**Decision:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `npm ci`, `npm run lint`, `npm test`, `npm run build` on every push/PR to `main` — no secrets required.

**Consequence:** If a future page is made static (prerendered) and its data-fetching path reads one of those env vars at module scope instead of inside a request-time function, CI's build step will start needing real secrets. If that happens, add the required values as Actions secrets rather than reverting this to lint+test only.

## 007 — `main` requires a PR; direct pushes blocked for everyone, including admins
**Date:** 2026-09-09

**Context:** Nothing stopped a direct push to `main` — no branch protection existed. With 5 collaborators and CI now able to gate lint/test/build, a push landing without going through a PR (and without CI having run against it first, since `push` and `pull_request` both trigger CI but a direct push only checks it *after* it's already on `main`) defeats the point of having CI at all.

**Decision:** GitHub branch protection on `main`: require a PR before merging, require the `lint-test-build` check to pass before merge, no required approving reviews (team chose speed over mandatory second-reviewer for now), and no bypass for admins (`enforce_admins: true` — "force PR" means everyone, including the owner).

**Consequence:** Nobody, including repo admins, can `git push origin main` directly anymore — including from this assistant. All work (mine and the team's) goes: branch → PR → CI green → merge. If this ever needs a genuine emergency bypass, an admin must temporarily disable the rule in GitHub Settings → Branches, push, then re-enable it — don't ask to "just force push."
